You should build a Todo Application with Redux. Requirements:

* Your application should use Redux for state management

  + `/` - the application itself. Shows all of todos (completed and active).
  + `/completed` - list of completed tasks.
  + `/active` - list of active (uncompleted) tasks.
  + `/all` - the same as `/`.
* You have to store your todos in `localStorage` and restore them after page reloading.

**Tip:** Consider [Todo Example](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html) from Redux docs.
