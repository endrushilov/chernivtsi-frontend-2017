# Graduation

Let's talk about assessment. During the course you had 6 homeworks, each of them costs 10 points. Final (graduation) task will let you try to use all of the learned experience in practice. It will cost 40 points. Homeworks + final task have 100 points total. You need to get at least 60 points, if you want to get a certificate of successful completion of the course.

Here's the proportion:

* **Total:** 100 points (homeworks+graduation)
* **Homework:** 60 points (6 tasks)
* **Graduation:** 40 points (technical+functional+additional requirements)
  + **Technical and functional requirements:** 30 points
  + **Additional requirements:** 10 points
